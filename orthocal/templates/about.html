	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Orthocal.info is an Eastern Orthodox calendar service providing
	commemorations, fasting, scripture
	readings and other information for each day of the liturgical year.
	The readings follow the Slavic calendar. The primary purpose of this
	service is to provide convenient access to daily devotional material lay persons
	and not to be an authoritative or comprehensive guide to the feasts and fasts
	of the Church. The service supports this goal by providing tools for
	mobile developers and parish webmasters, an Alexa skill, multiple types of
	feeds, and a web interface.
	</p>

	<h2>Contact the Author</h2>
	<p><a href="https://orthocal.info">Orthocal.info</a> is
	provided to the Orthodox community with no strings attached.
	However, it is helpful to me, the author of the work, to know who is
	using it and how. I will then be able to know how best to support
	your usage of the api and will be able to keep you informed about
	changes or maintenance work that needs to be done. Please contact
	me via the 
	<a href="https://parochianus.blog/contact/">contact form</a>
	on my blog, 
	<a href="https://parochianus.blog/">Parochianus</a>,
	and let me know about your usage. Please report bugs using the 
	<a href="https://github.com/brianglass/orthocal-python/issues">Github issue tracker</a>.
	And, as always, a link and an acknowledgement is nice, but not required.</p>

	<h2>Technology & Data</h2>
	<p>The <a href="https://github.com/brianglass/orthocal-python">Source Code</a>
	is freely available. The original version of this site was written in a
	combination of Go and Node.js, but has been rewritten in Python and Django
	since the author finds that much easier to maintain. The site is deployed on
	<a href="https://cloud.google.com/run">Google Cloud Run</a> and
	<a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>.
	The algorithm and calendar data used in this service are based on the
	algorithm and data developed by Paul Kachur for his
	<a href="https://github.com/paulkachur/orthodox_calendar">orthodox_calendar</a> project. 
	The lives of the saints are taken by permission from John Brady's
	<a href="http://abbamoses.com">Abbamoses.com</a>.</p>

	<h2>Scriptures</h2>
	<p>Because this is open-source and free, the service must use a
	translation of the Bible that is either public domain or has agreeable
	license terms. At this point I have chosen to stick with the King James
	Version. While not ideal, many clergy consider this to be one of the
	best options for Orthodox. Because the rubrics use Septuagint
	versification, a handful of the Old Testament readings may be incorrect.
	Some of the composite readings are taken from the translations of the
	Archimandrite Ephrem (Lash). His translations can be accessed at
	<a href="https://github.com/brianglass/anastasis">Anastasis.</a></p>
